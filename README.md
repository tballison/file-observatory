# File Observatory
This repo hosts development code used on the backend to support data ingestion into
an ElasticSearch index for the [SafeDocs File Observatory app](https://github.com/jpl-safedocs).

This repo contains pre-ALPHA grade code for demonstration purposes only.

Some capabilities demonstrated within have been integrated into Apache Tika. 
Some have been spun off into standalone projects, e.g. [commoncrawl-fetcher-lite](https://github.com/tballison/commoncrawl-fetcher-lite).

# Attribution
The commoncrawl-fetcher module includes code that relies on GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from
